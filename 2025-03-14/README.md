## Question 5 -> 
### Reverse the left and right numbers like
### You must use only a loop
### input 13
### output 6 5 4 3 2 1 7 13 12 11 10 9 8

- Reverses the first half of the sequence and prints the second half as is.
- Uses a `for` loop to split and rearrange numbers.

## Question 7 -> 
### Implement classes for a Library
### There are diffrent type of books are available in the library like Printed books, E books, and Audio books
### You must use inhertance, polymorphism, encapuslation...

- Implements a `Library` system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- Uses inheritance for `PrintedBook`, `EBook`, and `AudioBook` classes.
- Demonstrates polymorphism through method overriding.
### Output
